Use the Sidebar to navigate through the page
The home page comprises of a sample.
Create a new Invoice by going to the Create new invoice page from the sidebar menu.
I have already stored a little dummy data into Firestore.
I used basic Class Based CSS styling to make the Header Sidebar and Footer.
I used Compound Components along with styled components module to make totally Reusable components.
I used reactstrap Components to make the Create new Invoice form.
Used Firestore as the backend equivalent.
I have also hosted the project on netlify.
