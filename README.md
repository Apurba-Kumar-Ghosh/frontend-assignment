I used basic Class Based CSS styling to make the Header Sidebar and Footer.
I used Compound Components along with styled components module to make totally Reusable components.
I used reactstrap Components to make the Create new Invoice form.
Used Firestore as the backend equivalent.
I have not been able to finish the Pending invoice list till now
I will complete the entire project by Monday evening.
I have also hosted the project on netlify.
